          <p>The iPhone 11 Pro is Apple's latest iPhone that has people asking us 
            "What's really changed?" It's a fair question because it looks very 
            similar to last year's iPhone. But use the new cameras for a few minutes
             and both that question and inquisitive looks from doubters quickly fade.
            Apple put a lot of effort into its triple-lens rear camera, offering a 
            trio of 12MP lenses that shoot regular, telephoto, and brand new 
            ultra-wide perspectives. Not having to back up to fit everything 
            into the widened frame is a big perk. Also, all of our friends 
            appreciate not having their heads cut off in portrait photos.
          </p>
          <p>'Night Mode', meanwhile, addresses the single biggest complaint we've 
            heard from iPhone users over the years: photos in dimly-lit bars and 
            restaurants don't look very good – not next to their Android 
            phone-touting friends. The shame! 
              <br><br>
              Good news: the iPhone 11 Pro has the best low-light camera we've 
              tested on a phone – any phone. Apple brightens with the best of 
              them and its night mode is automatically applied, topping Samsung, 
              Huawei and Google's interfaces.
              <br><br>
              Video looks and sounds best-in-class from the oversized rear 
              cameras, yet we found the biggest year-over-year leap in the 
              physically smaller 12MP front camera. It now records in 4K and 
              shoots slo-mo video. Apple's 'Slofies' work best with long, flowing 
              hair to whip back and forth, so we had to get creative in our tests.
              <br><br>
              So much of the iPhone 11 Pro is about the camera, but there's a
               bit more. We found battery life noticeably better than the 
               iPhone XS – we've gone longer than a day with heavy use. You 
               don't need the Pro Max for its battery prowess. Its matte finish 
               back cover looks nicer and feels less slippery, though it won't 
               wow as much if you immediately stick an iPhone 11 Pro case on
                it (which we do recommend).
              <br><br>
              The 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro is the one to get if you want the most
               advanced iPhone that's easy to use with one hand. It feels a lot 
               smaller than the 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max and 6.1-inch iPhone 11.
                Don't be fooled by its size, though, it's pricier than the 
                telephoto-and-OLED-lacking entry-level iPhone 11.
              <br><br>
              It doesn't look different from past iPhones on the front, so it 
              may seem hard to justify the price. But if you've been waiting 
              for better photos and video out of a new iPhone, this is it – and 
              that's more important than a new look or 5G, at least in 2019.
          </p><br><br>
          <p2>Welcome to what's basically the iPhone 11 Pro camera review – we're 
            going to talk a lot about the four cameras and show you plenty of photos
             from each lens.
            Its rear camera trifecta offers wide, 2x optically zoomed and 
            all-encompassing ultra-wide perspectives, the latter being a first 
            for the iPhone. We found the iPhone  11 Pro cameras tout incredible 
            versatility – even in our own daily tech reporter lives. 
              
            We were able to zoom in on Apple CEO Tim Cook and the first iPhone 11 
            customer at the 5th Avenue store re-opening in New York City with the 
            telephoto lens, and then immediately punch out to take in the 
            surrounding celebratory crowd.
